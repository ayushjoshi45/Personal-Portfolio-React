            Hi, I'm Ayush Joshi, a passionate web developer from Nainital,
            Uttarakhand.

            I specialize in building dynamic and user-friendly applications,
            with a strong focus on the MERN Stack and modern web technologies.
            Over time, I’ve worked on several projects that reflect both my
            technical skills and creativity. Some of my favorites include:
            <br />
            - <span className="text-[#6200EE] font-bold">Job Portal</span> – a
            platform that connects job seekers and recruiters with smooth
            authentication and application management.
            <br />
            - <span className="text-[#6200EE] font-bold">Rental Marketplace</span> –
            where users can list and browse properties with an interactive,
            real-world experience.
            <br />
            - <span className="text-[#6200EE] font-bold">MoviesFlick</span> – a
            movie discovery platform powered by the TMDB API.
            <br />
            - <span className="text-[#6200EE] font-bold">Bubble Hit Game</span> –
            a fun JavaScript-based game where players score points by hitting
            bubbles with matching numbers.
            <br />
            When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing cricket or
            exploring the latest trends in technology. I enjoy learning,
            experimenting, and constantly pushing myself to build better
            projects.
